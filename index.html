<h2>About Me</h2>

<p class="multiline">
	Hi! I'm Lily, a queer Games Programming student from Scotland. I'm currrently in my 4th year at Abertay University.

	I'm rather passionate about gamedev, especially in the intersection between tools programming and gameplay programming.
	Projects I've worked on can be found <a href="/projects/">Here</a>.
	
	Aside from making games, I tend to play quite a lot of them, particularly older games. I especially enjoy observing the design patterns of the games I play through a technical lens, which in turn influences my thoughts and decisions when developing.
	Outside of games, I have started learning bass guitar, and I like to go on walks around the city!
	
	
	This website is a heavy work in progress, so don't mind the construction equipment!
