<h2>About Me</h2>

<p class="multiline">
	Hi! I'm Lily, a queer Games Programming student from Scotland. I'm currrently in my 4th year at Abertay University.
	
	/* Express interest in game dev here */
	
	Aside from making games, I tend to play quite a lot of them, particularly older games. I especially enjoy observing the design patterns of the games I play through a technical lens, which in turn influences my thoughts and decisions when developing.
	Outside of games, I have started learning bass guitar, and I like to go on walks around the city!
	
	
	This website is a heavy work in progress, so don't mind the construction equipment!
