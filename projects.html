<h2>Dragon's Harbour</h2>
<h3>Cozy Storybook Adventure</h3>
<p class="multiline">
This is a puzzle-platformer made in Unity for Abertay University's DES315 Professional Project module. I was a programmer and source control manager in a team of 8.
In particular I worked on the game's dialogue system, as well as the UI.
From this I learnt:
<ul>
<li>The process of creating well-documented tools for others to implement</li>
<li>Creating an accessible UI</li>
<li>Communication skills for directing the team on which git branches to use</li>
<li>Effectively resolving Git merge conflicts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cutesy Collection Platformer</h3>
<p class="multiline">
A game jam game made over the course of a week using Unity. I was a programmer in a team of 6.

From this I learnt:
<ul>
<li>Team building skills</li>
<li>Working under the pressure of a tight deadline</li>
<li>Working with WWise for Unity</li>
</ul>
